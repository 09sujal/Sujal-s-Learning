What are arrays, strings?
Edit

Arrays:
Arrays are collections of elements of the same type, accessible via indices. They allow efficient storage and retrieval of multiple values under a single variable name. In Python, lists often serve as arrays.

temperatures = [25, 28, 22, 30, 24]
In this example, temperatures is an array representing daily temperatures.

Strings are sequences of characters, used to represent textual information. They are immutable in many programming languages. Strings support operations like concatenation and slicing and are crucial for text processing.

message = "Hello, World!"
Here, message is a string containing a greeting.
